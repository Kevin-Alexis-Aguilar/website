        <p>Through the years, I've been built miniture cars, battleships, cannons, houses, and
        other creations. Recently, I improvised with my new vehicle and I ended up creating
        a steam truck that are from the early 1900s. If you view it from behind, it looks
        like a steam locomotive.</p>
        <p>Note: the truck is not propelled by actual steam.</p>

        <p>Speaking of vehicles, I made a crusier like vessel that measures
        110 centimeters! It has a double barred turret in the bow, behind
        and above it, lays a lone thine turret. Within the middle lays two
        lifeboats on its side with the captain's bridge in the center. An anti-
        aircraft gun is placed on the rear end of the poopdeck. Finally,
        A small torpedo gun is located at the stern of my beloved ship.</p>

        <p>Through the years, I've been built miniture cars, battleships, cannons, houses, and
        other creations. Recently, I improvised with my new vehicle and I ended up creating
        a steam truck that are from the early 1900s. If you view it from behind, it looks
        like a steam locomotive.</p>
        <p>Note: the truck is not propelled by actual steam.</p>

        <p>Speaking of vehicles, I made a crusier like vessel that measures
        110 centimeters! It has a double barred turret in the bow, behind
        and above it, lays a lone thine turret. Within the middle lays two
        lifeboats on its side with the captain's bridge in the center. An anti-
        aircraft gun is placed on the rear end of the poopdeck. Finally,
        A small torpedo gun is located at the stern of my beloved ship.</p>

      <p>Ole Kirk Christiansen was his name and he produced wooden toys at
      Denmark in 1932. He renamed his company to Lego as a combination of the
      word LEG GODT, which in dannish means "to play well." Coincidentally, the
      latin definition was "I put together." After World War II, Kirk decided to
      invest into plastic toys which became a success. Quickly though, the sales
      decline and Godtfred Kirk, his son, had to travel around the country to
      make ends meet. Fortunately, the whole family obtained more than enough
      food to get through the winter.
      </p>
      <p>On a business trip to England (1954), Godtfred spoke with a
      dissatisfied shopping center owner of the toys having no system in it.
      This gave Godtfred an idea that resulted the "first Lego System of Play"
      to released with critical success. The realistic town setting also taught
      traffic safety to children. In 1968, he began selling it to other European
      countries and later around the world.
      </p>
      <p>However the original legos could not stick together firmly and
      Godtfred noticed this when his son's creation crumbled. He discovered that
      putting tubes inside the bricks gave them better clutch power. From then
      on, the brick remained basically the same.
      </p>
      <p>Unfortunately, Ole Kirk Christiansen died in March of 1958 but his
        son kept moving foward and decided to make an airport to transport the
        products. He also convinced the company to ditch all production of
        wooden toys and to only focus on the Lego System. This went very well
        and Godtfred thought of an amusement park that is made out of Lego.
        600,000 guest came to the ground opening of Lego Land at Billmund in
        1968.
      </p>
      <p>In the year 2000, Lego was crowned "Toy of the Century." Today Lego
        sells billions of sets every year and countless adaptations to popular
        media have been made. Including partnerships with Minecraft, Marvel, DC,
        Disney, and others. Original films were also made such as "The Lego
        Movie." It is safe to say Lego will be here for a while longer.

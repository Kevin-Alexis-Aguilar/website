        Ole Kirk Christiansen was his name and he produced wooden toys at
        Denmark in 1932. He renamed his company to Lego as a combination of the
        word LEG GODT, which in Danish means "to play well." Coincidentally,
        the Latin definition was "I put together." After World War II, Kirk
        decided to invest into plastic toys which became a success. Quickly
        though, the sales decline and Godtfred Kirk, his son, had to travel
        around the country to make ends meet. Fortunately, the whole family
        obtained more than enough food to get through the winter.

        On a business trip to England (1954), Godtfred spoke with a dissatisfied
        shopping center owner of the toys having no system in it. This gave
        Godtfred an idea that resulted the "first Lego System of Play" to
        release with critical success. The realistic town setting also taught
        traffic safety to children. In 1968, he began selling it to other
        European countries and later around the world.

        However, the original legos could not stick together firmly and Godtfred
        noticed this when his son's creation crumbled. He discovered that
        putting tubes inside the bricks gave them better clutch power. From then
        on, the brick remained basically the same.

        Unfortunately, Ole Kirk Christiansen died in March of 1958, but his
        son kept moving forward and decided to make an airport to transport the
        products. He also convinced the company to ditch all production of
        wooden toys and to only focus on the Lego System. This went very well
        and Godtfred thought of an amusement park that is made of Lego.
        600,000 guests came to the grand opening of Lego Land at Billund in
        1968.

        In the year 2000, Lego was crowned "Toy of the Century." Today Lego
        also has made partnerships with Minecraft, Marvel, DC, Disney, and
        others. Original films such as "The Lego Movie" and "The Lego Batman
        Movie" were critical and financial successful. In conclusion, Lego is an
        amazing product and who knows what is its next move.

          Through the years, I've been built miniature cars, battleships,
          cannons, houses, and other creations. Recently, I improvised with my
          new vehicle, and I ended up creating a steam truck that are from the
          early 1900s. If you view it from behind, it looks like a steam
          locomotive.

          Note: the truck is not propelled by actual steam.

          Speaking of vehicles, I made a cruiser like vessel that measures 110
          centimeters! It has a double barred turret in the bow, behind and
          above it, lays a lone thine turret. Within the middle lays two
          lifeboats on its side with the captain's bridge in the center. An
          anti-aircraft gun is placed on the rear end of the poop deck. Finally,
          A small torpedo gun is located at the stern of my beloved ship.

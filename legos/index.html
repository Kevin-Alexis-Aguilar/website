        <p>Through the years, I've been built miniture cars, battleships, cannons, houses, and
        other creations. Recently, I improvised with my new vehicle and I ended up creating
        a steam truck that are from the early 1900s. If you view it from behind, it looks
        like a steam locomotive.</p>
        <p>Note: the truck is not propelled by actual steam.</p>
